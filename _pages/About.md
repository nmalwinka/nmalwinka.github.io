I am a bioinformatician with 6 years of experience in collaborative research and NGS data analysis. I am providing bioinformatics support to Patrick Chinneryâ€™s group at MRC MBU, University of Cambridge. With expertise and experience in scientific research and bioinformatics, I am uniquely positioned to integrate and consult on both areas of wet lab and dry lab research. My passion is seeing scientific advances benefiting the world.

I am excited about collaborative science, data integration, visualisation. My recent work focuses on exploring and in depth analysis of single cell RNA-seq, CROP-seq and MultiOme (scRNA-seq + ATAC-seq) datasets.
