I am a bioinformatician with 7.5 years of experience in collaborative research and NGS data analysis. With deep extensive experience in scientific research and bioinformatics, I am uniquely positioned to integrate and consult on both areas of wet lab and dry lab research. My passion is seeing scientific advances benefiting the world.![image](https://github.com/nmalwinka/nmalwinka.github.io/assets/23212108/2c70aef6-0a98-47fd-902d-d2385297af70)

In mu current role, I am providing bioinformatics expertise, leading projects and people at the Functional Genomics Centre, Cancer Research Horizons, Cambridge, UK.

Among my role responsibilities are:

•	Leading single-cell project portfolio (Perturb-seq) in dynamic environment, coordinating task distribution between team members, and ensuring quality work and timely project delivery
•	Line-managing and recruiting new staff for bioinformatic team
•	Managing multiple other CRIPSR projects, working closely with wet lab scientists and project stakeholders, consulting on experimental design, running pipelines and custom projects, and delivering results and reports within timelines
•	Contributing to development and deployment of bioinformatic solutions on AWS
•	Established new CRISPR screen capabilities
•	Performing lethality, isogenic, epigenetic, gene tiling and in-vivo CRISPR screen analyses
•	Collaboratively working with other bioinformaticians and researchers on technology development and portfolio projects
•	Writing a manuscript for publication

In my previous role, I have been providing bioinformatics expertise to Patrick Chinnery’s group at MRC MBU, University of Cambridge. My work there focused on exploring and in depth analysis of single cell RNA-seq, CROP-seq and MultiOme (scRNA-seq + ATAC-seq) datasets, as well as writing Nextflow pipeline for single cell multiome CROP-seq processing.


I am excited about collaborative science, data integration, visualisation.
